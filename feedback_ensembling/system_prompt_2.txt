Essay: Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.
First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.
Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.

Feedback: Thesis Statement: The thesis statement in the essay is clear and well-elaborated, presenting the author's standpoint on the issue of competition versus cooperation.

Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay presents one distinct argumentative claim in favor of the author's standpoint, which is the importance of cooperation in teaching interpersonal skills.

Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The essay provides some evidence to support the claim about the significance of cooperation in teaching interpersonal skills, such as the ability to listen to others' opinions and think comprehensively. However, the evidence could be more specific and well-aligned with the claim. For instance, the author could include an example of a specific teamwork activity or study that demonstrates the development of these skills through cooperation. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more in-depth reasoning to explain how the acquisition of interpersonal skills through cooperation would benefit individuals in their future lives.

Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any distinct claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement.

Essay: More people are migrating to other countries than ever before
The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.
Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.
Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.
To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.

However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced. Consider adding qualifiers such as "often", "typically" or "in many cases" to acknowledge that there may be situations where competition is also beneficial. For instance, you can rewrite one of the sentences as follows: "Generally, it is beneficial for students to be taught to compete in certain areas, while cooperation is also important for developing interpersonal skills and teamwork."

Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay presents two distinct argumentative claims in favor of cooperation: 1) Cooperation helps children learn interpersonal skills that are significant for their future, and 2) Competition requires cooperation to achieve success. These claims are clear and aligned with the thesis statement. To improve the persuasiveness of the essay, you can consider adding a third claim to explain how cooperation promotes emotional development or emotional intelligence.

Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The essay provides reasoning for both claims, explaining how cooperation helps children learn skills such as listening, communication, and compromise. It also provides an example of how competition in the Olympic games requires the cooperation of various professionals. However, the essay lacks specific evidence to support these claims. Also, consider providing examples or research studies that demonstrate the benefits of cooperation in developing interpersonal skills and achieving success in competitive situations.

Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any distinct argumentative claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement. Consider adding at least one claim that presents a counterargument to make the essay more balanced and persuasive. An example of a claim that challenges the importance of cooperation in primary education is "Competition promotes individual achievement and helps children develop resilience and perseverance.". Additionally, you can also discuss how competition can promote individual growth and motivation.

Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay. However, if you add an attacking claim, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the counterargument and provides specific evidence or reasoning to support your standpoint.

Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main arguments and thesis of the essay. However, it could be strengthened by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life, such as personal relationships, social interactions, work environments, and global cooperation for solving complex problems. Additionally, consider ending the conclusion with a thought-provoking statement or a call to action to leave a lasting impact on the reader.

Overall, the essay provides a clear standpoint on the issue and presents valid arguments in favor of cooperation. To improve, consider adding qualifiers to the thesis statement, providing specific evidence to support the claims, adding at least one attacking claim, and strengthening the conclusion by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life. Good job, and keep up the good work!
