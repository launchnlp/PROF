Essay: Dear San Francisco Board of Supervisors,
Given the government has decided to impose a new increase in minimum wage, prioritizing the well-being of the people is important. Despite the rapid increase of the latest automation and the quickest, easiest methods in San Francisco's industrial landscape, we must save our workforce from the price floor the government has placed on the labor market. To advocate for the common worker, we must implement measures to counter the swift rise of automation in this era of industrialization.
Therefore, I strongly oppose just taxing automation, or Ms. Kim\u2019s proposal. When the minimum wage surpasses the equilibrium rate in the labor market, it triggers various economic repercussions. Companies will pay for automation because it\u2019s more efficient, even if there\u2019s a tax. Employees may seek alternative solutions beyond human labor to fulfill job roles, given that machines are generally faster, cheaper, and more efficient than humans.
You might wonder why I think we shouldn\u2019t embrace this new industrial automation, given machines' superior speed and precision compared to humans. The answer is simple: machines lack the human capability for critical thinking and problem-solving, attributes that are indispensable in the workforce. If we only put a tax on automation, automation will still replace the labor force. Apart from ethical considerations, human labor often proves more cost-effective and sustainable due to its adaptability. It's crucial to recognize that widespread automation could not only lower general income and exacerbate income inequality in San Francisco but also diminish the willingness to pay for goods and services over time, thus yielding negative repercussions. The negatives go on\u2014 in a society where the tax was imposed automation would still take over as the benefits of a decreased wage of labor would levy companies to take the tax on top of it. 
Instead, policymakers may consider alternative measures such as investing in education and programs aimed at benefiting workers before exploiting the industry. Providing incentives for businesses to invest in automation responsibly, or implementing policies that ensure the benefits of automation are shared more equitably among workers and society as a whole. The economy and the common man are hurt in the process of the shift towards automation and without letting policy makers like yourselves know the long term benefits of only imposing a tax our nation stands shadowed under the wrath of cheap labor.
In conclusion, banning automation across the entire industry stands as the most beneficial intervention in this scenario. While acknowledging that automation may indeed replace certain jobs, imposing a tax and accounting for its long-term adverse effects positions us to advocate for the people's interests in the long run, while also aiding companies in adapting to changing economic landscapes.

Feedback: Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: As I was reading through this letter, I noticed that many fundamental concepts were missing. For example, the author forgot to mention that an increase in the minimum wage, set by a binding price floor, results in a surplus of labor, as quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded. Also, if the price of labor goes up in tandem with an imposition of taxes on automation, then the supply of goods and services produced using labor and automation will decrease, causing equilibrium price and quantity to increase and decrease respectively. Additionally, the author failed to mention how consumer, producer, and total surplus would be affected by the tax, which is a crucial component of this prompt.
Understanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: To reiterate, I felt that while the author does a good job at talking about the markets individually, they do not talk about how they are all interconnected. The author can explain that the change in minimum wage would not only cause a surplus in labor, but an increase in the demand for automation, because labor and automation are most possibly substitutes in the production of particular goods and services. When the ban is imposed on automation, the dynamics between these markets become much more complex. For example, in the market for goods and services, the supply of these goods and services now decreases, reducing equilibrium quantity while simultaneously increasing the equilibrium price. Therefore, not only would suppliers pay, in the form of added input costs, but so would consumers, who are now forced to pay a higher price to receive the same goods that were cheaper before the tax on automation.
Critical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author gave a very brief description of how an increase in the minimum wage affects markets, such as the labor market, by stating that it \u201ctriggers various economic repercussions.\u201d beyond that, they did not, but should explain how it creates a surplus of labor in the labor market, as laborers are enticed by a higher wage, while employers are deterred, because they see it as a potential rise in input costs, which will significantly affect profits. They can also improve their analysis of the tax on automation by explaining how it may affect both producers and consumers of the goods and services produced by labor and automation. Hence, both producers and consumers of these goods and services may experience a decrease in producer and consumer surplus.
Critical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: In my opinion, I feel that there was a lot more the author could have done to effectively justify his/her position. It appeared to me that the author\u2019s primary argument against taxation was that producers will still continue to use automation regardless of a tax, which is not necessarily true. To advance their argument, the author could have spoken from an efficiency standpoint, explaining that total welfare is prevented from being maximized as a result of the tax on automation; this would occur, because of either a decrease in consumer or producer surplus or both. Also, they could have argued that automation acts as a lifeline for producers who need a cheaper and more efficient alternative to labor, and adding the tax on automation would force many of these producers to exit the market and stop producing.
Critical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: From my understanding, the writer used the Saltsman article on the wage floor, but did not accurately cite it. They could resolve this by citing the article on a work cited page.
Response Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: In all honesty, while the content discussed in the letter was pretty comprehensible, I found the general argument against the tax on automation to be confusing. For instance, the author stated that, \u201cIf we only put a tax on automation, automation will still replace the labor force.\u201d However, I believe that this truly depends on the magnitude of the tax on automation; if producers can generate more profit using human labor than automation, then they will use labor, and not automation like the author implied.\u201d On a more positive note, a part that I thought was very well explained was the potential solutions to the rising minimum wage, such as investing in education.

Essay: Dear San Fransisco Board of Supervisors, 
There are key microeconomic ramifications to be considered regarding the current policy proposals regarding automation. When government imposes a minimum wage increase, we see that the supply for labor from citizens rises through an incentive to earn more money. On the other hand, suppliers see a raised minimum wage as a reason to cut back on spending and hiring, in order to compensate for money lost due to a price floor. In this case, we see a shift from a non-binding price floor to a minimum price which makes it impossible to reach our former equilibrium where we had no surplus of labor. While companies look to cut marginal costs to production, we see a profound impact on the automation market where there may be a “strong incentive to automate or embrace self-service” (Michael Saltsman) from companies. 
Regarding Mr.Yee’s proposal on banning automation, it would be helpful to recognize the possibility of unintended economic consequences. The long-term effects of an automation ban could have unforseen consequences on the market for goods and services and could cause inefficiencies in the labor market. To start, it is important to note that a ban on automation would put the city at a great economic disadvantage regarding their output and contribution to the economy. Companies could go out of business and competitors will have an upper hand against local businesses trying to stay afloat with new production costs sky rocketing. 
There are also potential consequences that an automation ban could have on the labor market. This ban could effectively lower demand for human labor based on the fact that automation has become greatly intertwined with companies methods of operation in recent years. Due to increased costs of production and the need to restructure means of production, there is potential for layoffs and decreased demand for human labor. Producers are constantly trying to maximize surplus. Imposing a minimum wage may momentarily benefit select workers. But, Mr.Yee’s proposal, like the enforcement of a minimum wage, ignores key economic trends. The assumption that the loss of manufacturing and service jobs is purely due to technological advancement and companies’ efficiency goals is precarious. Unintended consequences are inevitable. When a company has an opportunity to sell, they react by comparing the market price to their marginal cost, and for a price less than their production cost, they are better off letting this item sit, and doing no work, than selling it and obtaining a negative producer surplus. This idea has a possible entry into our situation regarding delivery businesses. As Saltsman discusses, if producers have limitations to their abilities in production, like if “employers are prohibited from embracing an automated alternative, they'll either stop delivering food or close their doors” (Saltsman)”. In this situation, we see the company either impact the labor market or the market for their good or service, based on their decision to either cut back on costs hiring less workers, or raise the price for consumers, potentially causing a recession.

A Concerned Citizen

Feedback: Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: When the author are talking about the minimum wage increase, the author may need consumer/producer/total surplus and deadweight loss to explain that. For example, the author may say ‘the binding price floor will increase producer surplus and decrease consumer surplus in the labor market.’ Since the author are talking about the banning policy, he/she needs to mention quota and quota rent made by limiting the quantity. However, throughout the essay, he/she focuses more on explaining the effect of minimum wage rather than explaining why he/she protests the banning policy using quota and quota rent. He/she may say like ‘the banning policy creates quota and therefore generates huge amount of quota rents. This will decrease both the producer surplus and the consumer surplus.’
Understanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The author quote the statements in Wall Street Journal and have a correct understanding of those policies. However, he/she did not efficiently link the concepts with the protest. When the author explaining the banning policy, he/she may need more explanations on why the policy decrease the total surplus and what other effects will the policy make. For example, he/she can say ‘this policy will motivate the black market trading, making huge amount of illegal purchases.’
Critical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: When explaining the minimum wage increase, the author may use binding/non-binding price floor and deadweight loss to explain the effect of minimum wage increase. In addition, the author may have more explanations on why the policy decrease the total surplus and what other effects will the policy make. For example, he/she can say ‘this policy will motivate the black market trading, making huge amount of illegal purchases.’
Critical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author may use some numeric analysis to explain the impact about minimum wage increase and banning automation policy. For example, he/she may list some kinds of statistic data about how minimum wage impacts peoples’ life or about what banning automation policy do on the labor market. In addition, the author may need more than one market to explain those stuff. Note that automation is parallel to labor - there are two different markets, also goods made by automation and labor is good market - the third market. The author may state the relationship between those three markets.
Critical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: No, the author may need to cite the Wall Street Journal. This is Saltsman, Michael. "San Francisco's Problem Isn't Robots; It's the $15 Wage Floor; The city fears automation will replace workers--but its own policies make low-value jobs illegal." Wall Street Journal (Online), Nov 24, 2017.

Response Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: The author did a good job on explaining the concepts he used. All parts are easy to understand and easy to grab the author’s thought.
