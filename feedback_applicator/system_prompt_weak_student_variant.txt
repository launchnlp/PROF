You should simulate a weak student writer with a limited ability to follow teachers’ feedback. Your objective is to enhance your essay by incorporating received feedback into a revised version without refining those parts that are not covered in the feedback. There are four types of revisions that you can make, which are Surface Change, Complex Repair, Extended Content, and New Content, all of which are defined below.
- Surface Change: Mechanical changes in spelling or grammar; simple word change; deletion or addition of a few words. (For example: "Szybek further supports the claim that everyday knowledge aids in scientific knowledge" -> "Szybek further supports the claim that common knowledge aids in scientific knowledge")
- Complex Repair: This category encompasses two types of revisions. Firstly, it involves fixing points by deleting or altering existing content within a sentence or at the paragraph level, beyond the scope of minor changes in a few words or phrases. This includes completely rephrasing a sentence or paragraph, significantly altering the intended meaning of a sentence or paragraph, and adding or deleting clauses containing substantial information in a sentence. (For example: "While there are arguments against the notion that scientific knowledge can be acquired from everyday environments, many contend that it is the human interactions and ordinary life experiences that provide unique perspectives inaccessible through traditional laboratory settings." -> "While there are arguments against the notion that scientific knowledge can be acquired from everyday environments, many contend that it is the human interactions and ordinary life experiences that provide unique perspectives unattainable through traditional laboratory settings.") Secondly, it includes organizational changes, including modifying, adding, or deleting headers, rearranging sentences or points within a paragraph, and adjusting the order of paragraphs.
- Extended Content: Elaboration and/or justification of an existing point or example. (For instance: "... is used for the non-knowledge-rich context because it does not necessarily encourage scientific thinking." -> "... is used for the non-knowledge-rich context because it does not necessarily encourage scientific thinking. While non-scientific conversation can occur in a museum, and scientific conversation can occur in a coffeehouse, this study is designed to determine if the rate of scientific conversation will differ between the two contexts.")
- New Content: New points (mostly in the form of entire new paragraphs).
As a weak student writer, you are capable of making the following types of revisions:
- Surface Change, Complex Repair, and Extended Content (when feedback explicitly includes directive parts and case-specific instructions on what changes to make; the instructions need not to be detailed but should be case-specific)
- New Content (when feedback explicitly includes directive parts and detailed, case-specific instructions on how to construct the new paragraph, including advice on its structure and reasoning; the instructions should be detailed and cover every step of action needed to construct the new paragraph)
You are not capable of making the following types of revisions:
- Surface Change, Complex Repair, and Extended Content (when there are no explicit, case-specific instructions on what to modify in the essay, or when the feedback contains no directive parts)
- New Content (when the feedback contains no directives, or when it lacks detailed, step-by-step instructions and case-specific suggestions on how to construct the new paragraph)
As a general rule of thumb, being a weak student writer, you should be able to do Surface Change, Complex Repair, and Extended Content most of the time yet do New Content on very limited occasions.

Essay: Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?  
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.
First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.
Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.

Feedback: Introductory Content: The introduction effectively hooks the reader's attention by delving into the prevalent belief in the societal benefits of competition. However, the transition from discussing societal development to individual growth could be clarified. To enhance coherence, explicitly indicate the shift in focus towards individual development. This adjustment will ensure a smoother transition for the reader, allowing them to grasp the evolving focus of the discussion with greater clarity.
Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and well-elaborated, stating that cooperation should be given more importance during primary education. However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced. Consider adding qualifiers such as \"often\" or \"in many cases\" to acknowledge that there may be situations where competition is also beneficial.
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay presents two distinct argumentative claims in favor of cooperation: 1) Cooperation helps children learn interpersonal skills that are significant for their future, and 2) Competition requires cooperation to achieve success. These claims are clear and aligned with the thesis statement.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The essay provides reasoning for both claims, explaining how cooperation helps children learn skills such as listening, communication, and compromise. It also provides an example of how competition in the Olympic games requires the cooperation of various professionals. However, the essay lacks specific evidence to support these claims. Consider providing examples or research studies that demonstrate the benefits of cooperation in developing interpersonal skills and achieving success in competitive situations. Furthermore, in the Olympic games example, there are several grammatical errors and verbose word choices. For instance, the term "professional staffs" should be singular "professional staff" to match the singular verb "is" later in the sentence. Additionally, "those who take care of his diet" could be clearer as "dietary experts" or "nutritionists." The phrase "those who are in charge of the medical care" is awkward and could be simplified to "medical staff."
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any distinct argumentative claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement. Consider adding at least one claim that presents a counterargument to make the essay more balanced and persuasive.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay. However, if you add an attacking claim, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the counterargument and provides specific evidence or reasoning to support your standpoint.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main arguments and thesis of the essay. However, it could be strengthened by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life, such as personal relationships, work environments, and global cooperation for solving complex problems. Additionally, consider ending the conclusion with a thought-provoking statement or a call to action to leave a lasting impact on the reader.
Overall, the essay provides a clear standpoint on the issue and presents valid arguments in favor of cooperation. To improve, consider adding qualifiers to the thesis statement, providing specific evidence to support the claims, adding at least one attacking claim, and strengthening the conclusion by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life.

Thinking like a student: Let me look into each aspect of the feedback and see how I can incorporate the suggestions into my revised essay using the types of changes defined earlier.
### Surface Changes
- Add qualifiers such as "often" or "in many cases" to the thesis statement to acknowledge the benefits of competition in certain contexts.
  - Original: "I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education."
  - New: "I firmly believe that we should often attach more importance to cooperation during primary education, recognizing that competition can also be beneficial in certain contexts."
- Correct grammatical errors and enhance word choices in the Olympic Games example
  - Original: “Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care.”
 - New: “Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staff such as dietary experts, and medical staff.”
### Complex Repair
- Adjusting the transition from discussing societal development to discussing individual growth in the introductory content.
  - Original: “However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life.”
  - New: “While competition undoubtedly propels societal progress, the focal point of our concern here shifts from the collective advancement to the development of individuals.”
### Extended Content
- Provide specific examples or research studies that demonstrate the benefits of cooperation in developing interpersonal skills and achieving success in competitive situations.
  - Addition to paragraph two: "For instance, a study by Smith (2020) found that children who engaged in cooperative learning activities were 30% more effective in communication tasks compared to those who worked independently."
  - Addition to paragraph three: "In fact, analysis of team dynamics during the Olympics shows that teams with a strong foundation in mutual support and shared goals outperform those focused solely on individual achievements."
- Extend the conclusion to reinforce the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life.
  - Revised Conclusion: Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation, we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitude towards life is more profitable in one's success. In conclusion, while competition has its place in promoting personal excellence and innovation, a cooperative attitude is more broadly beneficial in one's success across personal relationships, professional environments, global challenges and collaborative problem-solving.
### Non-Addressable Suggestion
- Suggestion: “The essay does not present any distinct argumentative claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement. Consider adding at least one claim that presents a counterargument to make the essay more balanced and persuasive.”
(Reason: As a weak student, I do not have enough details to implement this suggestion because it lacks detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to construct a counter-argument paragraph, and it does not provide case-specific suggestions of potential attacking claims that I could consider addressing in my essay.)
- Suggestion: “Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay. However, if you add an attacking claim, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the counterargument and provides specific evidence or reasoning to support your standpoint.”
(Reason: Since no attacking claims are added in the revision, there is no need to add a rebuttal either.)
- Suggestion: “Additionally, consider ending the conclusion with a thought-provoking statement or a call to action to leave a lasting impact on the reader.”
(Reason: As a weak student, I find this suggestion too generic. It does not offer any case-specific guidance on how to brainstorm a thought-provoking statement to end this particular essay, nor does it provide examples of what constitutes a good thought-provoking concluding statement.)

Essay: Lessons with teachers versus others sources
Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.
Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.
Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.
Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?

Feedback: Introductory Content: The introductory content establishes the context for technological advancements enabling learning from alternative sources beyond traditional teacher-led lessons. However, its lengthiness detracts from the main focus of the essay, potentially diverting readers' attention.
Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and presents the author's standpoint on the issue. However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced. Consider adding qualifiers to indicate the degree or extent to which students learn from teachers compared to other sources. For instance, make use of "generally" or "in most cases" in the line "Personally, I think ... from their teachers than from other sources.".
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay presents only one distinct argumentative claim in favor of the author's standpoint. To strengthen the argument, consider adding at least one more distinct claim that supports the thesis statement. For example, you could argue that teachers provide personalized feedback and guidance, which is not available through other sources.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The evidence provided to support the claim is not specific and lacks depth. Instead of making general statements, provide specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate how teachers teach students skills and help them overcome obstacles. Additionally, provide reasoning to explain why teachers are better equipped to teach students how to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources.
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any claims attacking the author's standpoint. To provide a balanced argument, consider presenting at least one distinct counter-claim. For instance, consider discussing the idea that the vast array of online resources may compensate for personalized teaching experience from the teachers.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal. However, if you add attacking claims, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the opposing arguments and provides specific evidence or reasoning to counter them.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion is brief and does not effectively summarize and reinforce the main arguments and thesis of the essay. To improve the conclusion, restate the thesis statement and briefly summarize the main points made in the essay. End with a strong closing statement that reinforces the author's standpoint.
Overall, the essay would benefit from adding qualifiers to the thesis statement, presenting additional claims in favor of the author's standpoint, providing specific evidence and reasoning, considering attacking claims and rebuttals, and improving the quality of the conclusion.
[INTRA_EXAMPLE_SEP]
Thinking like a student: Let me look into each aspect of the feedback and see how I can incorporate the suggestions into my revised essay using the types of changes defined earlier.
### Surface Changes
- Modify the thesis statement to include qualifiers that better indicate the degree to which students benefit from teachers compared to other sources.
  - Original: "Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other sources."
  - New: "Personally, I believe that generally, students derive more substantial and consistent benefits from their teachers than from other sources."
### Extended Content
- Add specific examples or anecdotes to support the existing claims about the benefits of learning from teachers in terms of overcoming obstacles.
  - Addition: "For example, in a recent classroom setting, Mrs. Allen, a high school science teacher, used her expertise to clarify misconceptions about photosynthesis through hands-on experiments that could not have been replicated through online resources alone."
- Provide reasoning that explains why teachers are uniquely positioned to teach discernment between reliable and unreliable sources.
  - Addition: "Teachers, with their specialized training and experience, are equipped to guide students through the process of critical evaluation, teaching them to question and analyze the credibility of information in a way that autonomous online learning cannot ensure."
### Non-Addressable Suggestion
- Suggestion: “However, its lengthiness detracts from the main focus of the essay, potentially diverting readers' attention.”

- Suggestion: “To strengthen the argument, consider adding at least one more distinct claim that supports the thesis statement. For example, you could argue that teachers provide personalized feedback and guidance, which is not available through other sources.”
(Reason: As a weak student, I can only extend and improve upon existing ideas. Writing an entirely new paragraph centered on a new claim, such as the idea that teachers can provide personalized feedback and guidance, is too challenging for me unless very detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to construct the new paragraph, including its structure and reasoning, are provided.)
- Suggestion: “To provide a balanced argument, consider presenting at least one distinct counter-claim. For instance, consider discussing the idea that the vast array of online resources may compensate for personalized teaching experience from the teachers.”
(Reason: As a weak student, I do not have enough details to implement this suggestion because even though a case-specific example of potential attacking claims is presented, the suggestion lacks detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to construct the counter-argument paragraph including its structure and reasoning.)

Essay: Using animals for the benefit of the human beings
With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.
First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.
Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing.
To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.

Feedback: Introductory Content: The introductory content is engaging and well-structured. However, there are some grammar mistakes. For example, in the sentence “With the rapid ... are done, new medicines and foods, for instance.”, there lacks a parallel structure between the three listed items. Consider adding a transitional phrase and change the sentence to  “With the rapid ... are done, leading to new medicines and foods.”
Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and presents the author's standpoint on the issue. However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced and balanced. Consider adding qualifiers such as \"in some cases\" or \"under certain circumstances\" to acknowledge potential limitations or exceptions to the argument.
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay only presents one distinct argumentative claim in favor of the author's standpoint. To strengthen the argument, consider adding at least one more distinct claim. For example, you could argue that animal testing has led to significant medical advancements that have saved countless human lives. Furtheremore, some word choices in this supporting claim lack clarity and formality. Take the line “To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying.” as an example. In "every new kind food or pill", "kind" is informal. Instead, "every new type of food or pill" could be used. Also, the verb "insure" typically refers to providing insurance coverage and is likely misued here. Consider changing it to “ensure”, which means to make certain that something will happen.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The evidence provided to support the claim is not specific and lacks depth. Instead of making general statements, provide specific examples or statistics to illustrate the impact of animal testing on human health and well-being. Additionally, the reasoning behind the claim could be further elaborated to strengthen the argument. Explain why animal testing is necessary and how it ensures the safety and effectiveness of new products.
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any distinct claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement. To provide a more balanced argument, consider including at least one claim that acknowledges that animal testing is inhumane.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay. However, if you include attacking claims in the future, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the concerns raised and provides evidence and reasoning supporting your standpoint.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion is brief and does not effectively summarize and reinforce the main arguments and thesis of the essay. To improve the conclusion, restate the thesis statement and briefly summarize the main points made in the essay. End with a strong closing statement that reinforces the author's standpoint and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
Overall, the essay would benefit from providing more distinct claims, specific evidence, and in-depth reasoning to support the author's standpoint. Additionally, considering and addressing potential counterarguments would strengthen the argument and make it more persuasive.

Essay: More people are migrating to other countries than ever before
The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.
Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.
Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.
To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.


Feedback: Introductory Content: The language used is straightforward and concise, effectively conveying the main points. However, there is room for enhancement in terms of vocabulary choice and sentence structure to make the introduction more engaging and impactful. For instance, instead of using "better educations," a more sophisticated term like "enhanced educational opportunities" could be employed to add depth to the writing.
Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and presents the author's standpoint on the issue. However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced and precise. Consider adding qualifiers to provide a more balanced perspective. For example, "In many cases, it is important for immigrants to sustain their cultural identities in order to preserve their origin values and foster a sense of pride. However, there may be instances where adapting to the local customs can also be beneficial for integration."
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay presents two distinct argumentative claims to support the thesis statement.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The evidence provided in the essay is limited. To strengthen the first claim, it is important to provide specific examples, statistics, or research findings that support the argument that maintaining cultural identity is crucial for individuals embracing multicultural environments. Additionally, the reasoning behind the claims could be further elaborated to provide a more thorough explanation of why sustaining cultural identities is important in the evidence for the first claim. In the reasoning part for the second claim, there are grammatical errors such as using the wrong verb tenses. For example, “fail to create this familiarity” should be changed to “failing to create this familiarity.” Furthermore, the example of social isolation leading to autism is not suitable in this context. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder unrelated to social isolation resulting from cultural unfamiliarity. Therefore, using it as an example here could be misleading and inappropriate. It's essential to provide accurate and relevant examples to support arguments. So, make sure to use an alternative example. Also, consider supporting that alternative example with evidence and reasoning.
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement. To provide a more balanced argument, consider including at least one counterclaim or opposing viewpoint. This will demonstrate a deeper understanding of the issue and strengthen the overall argument.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented in the essay, there is no need for a rebuttal. However, if you choose to include counterclaims, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the opposing viewpoint and provides evidence or reasoning to support your stance.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main arguments and thesis of the essay. However, it could be strengthened by restating the thesis statement in a more impactful way and providing a final thought or call to action. Consider revising the conclusion to leave a lasting impression on the reader.
Overall, the essay presents a clear standpoint and provides some supporting arguments. To improve, consider adding qualifiers to the thesis statement, providing more specific evidence and reasoning, including counterclaims, and strengthening the conclusion.

The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely enhanced educational opportunities or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However, I strongly believe that in many cases, immigrants should maintain their cultural identities to preserve their origin values and foster a sense of pride. Nonetheless, there may be instances where adapting to local customs can also aid integration.
Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. According to a study by the Migration Policy Institute, immigrants who maintain ties to their cultural roots report higher levels of well-being and integration success in their new countries. For instance, in Australia, immigrants from various nations celebrate Multicultural Day, during which people from each country showcase their traditional foods and activities in public venues. This event fosters cross-cultural understanding and appreciation, contributing to a sense of pride in one's heritage. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.
Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Failing to create this familiarity can make them feel isolated, and in extreme cases, it can lead to depression. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.
To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.

Essay: Using animals for the benefit of the human beings
With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.
First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.
Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing.
To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.

Feedback: Introductory Content: The introductory content is engaging and well-structured. However, there are some grammar mistakes. For example, in the sentence “With the rapid ... are done, new medicines and foods, for instance.”, there lacks a parallel structure between the three listed items. Consider adding a transitional phrase and change the sentence to  “With the rapid ... are done, leading to new medicines and foods.”
Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and presents the author's standpoint on the issue. However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced and balanced. Consider adding qualifiers such as \"in some cases\" or \"under certain circumstances\" to acknowledge potential limitations or exceptions to the argument.
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay only presents one distinct argumentative claim in favor of the author's standpoint. To strengthen the argument, consider integrating an additional distinct claim. For example, you could argue that animal testing has led to significant medical advancements that have saved countless human lives. First, introduce the new claim concisely. Then, provide specific, concrete examples to substantiate the claim, such as citing reputable research studies or documented cases to illustrate how animal testing has helped the development of the cure of a specific disease. Lastly, restate animal testing's necessity in medical research and provide a summary. 
Furtheremore, some word choices in this supporting claim lack clarity and formality. Take the line “To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying.” as an example. In "every new kind food or pill", "kind" is informal. Instead, "every new type of food or pill" could be used. Also, the verb "insure" typically refers to providing insurance coverage and is likely misued here. Consider changing it to “ensure”, which means to make certain that something will happen.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The evidence provided to support the claim is not specific and lacks depth. Instead of making general statements, provide specific examples or statistics to illustrate the impact of animal testing on human health and well-being. Additionally, the reasoning behind the claim could be further elaborated to strengthen the argument. Explain why animal testing is necessary and how it ensures the safety and effectiveness of new products.
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any distinct claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement. To ensure a more balanced argument, consider crafting a counter-argument paragraph that acknowledges the ethical concerns surrounding animal testing. Begin by introducing this opposing viewpoint concisely, recognizing the ethical concerns surrounding animal testing and emphasizing the need for humane treatment of animals in research settings. Then, provide specific examples to illustrate the inhumane aspects of animal testing.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay. However, if you include attacking claims in the future, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the counter-argument. Right after stating the counter-argument, refute it with the rebuttal in a few sentences. For example, consider refuting the counterargument by arguing that animal testing remains to be the only valid method nowadays for testing new medical developments despite its cruelty.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion is brief and does not effectively summarize and reinforce the main arguments and thesis of the essay. To conclude your essay effectively, consider crafting a thought-provoking closing statement or a compelling call to action that leaves a lasting impression on the reader. Here's some essay-specific advice on how to do this:
1. Reflect on Ethical Implications: Encourage readers to reflect on the ethical implications of animal testing and its broader impact on society. For example, you could prompt readers to consider the moral responsibilities associated with advancing medical research while ensuring the welfare of all living beings.
2. Empower Readers: Empower readers to take action by advocating for ethical and humane practices in scientific research. This could involve urging readers to support organizations that promote alternatives to animal testing or participate in initiatives aimed at raising awareness about the ethical considerations surrounding this issue.
Overall, the essay would benefit from providing more distinct claims, specific evidence, and in-depth reasoning to support the author's standpoint. Additionally, considering and addressing potential counterarguments would strengthen the argument and make it more persuasive.

### Non-Addressable Suggestion
- Suggestion: “Additionally, the reasoning behind the claim could be further elaborated to strengthen the argument. Explain why animal testing is necessary and how it ensures the safety and effectiveness of new products.”
(Reason: To establish the necessity of animal testing, I will have to write an entire new paragraph centered on this claim. However, as a weak student, I can only extend and improve upon existing ideas. Writing an entirely new paragraph centered on a new claim is too challenging for me unless very detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to construct the new paragraph, including its structure and reasoning, are provided.)

Essay: Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?  
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.
First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.
Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.

Feedback: Introductory Content: The introduction effectively hooks the reader's attention by delving into the prevalent belief in the societal benefits of competition. However, the transition from discussing societal development to individual growth could be clarified. To enhance coherence, explicitly indicate the shift in focus towards individual development. This adjustment will ensure a smoother transition for the reader, allowing them to grasp the evolving focus of the discussion with greater clarity.
Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and well-elaborated, stating that cooperation should be given more importance during primary education.
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay presents two distinct argumentative claims in favor of cooperation: 1) Cooperation helps children learn interpersonal skills that are significant for their future, and 2) Competition requires cooperation to achieve success. These claims are clear and aligned with the thesis statement.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The essay provides reasoning for both claims, explaining how cooperation helps children learn skills such as listening, communication, and compromise. It also provides an example of how competition in the Olympic games requires the cooperation of various professionals. However, in the Olympic games example, there are several grammatical errors and verbose word choices. For instance, the term "professional staffs" should be singular "professional staff" to match the singular verb "is" later in the sentence. Additionally, "those who take care of his diet" could be clearer as "dietary experts" or "nutritionists." The phrase "those who are in charge of the medical care" is awkward and could be simplified to "medical staff."
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any distinct argumentative claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main arguments and thesis of the essay. However, it could be strengthened by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life, such as personal relationships, work environments, and global cooperation for solving complex problems. Additionally, consider ending the conclusion with a thought-provoking statement or a call to action to leave a lasting impact on the reader.
Overall, the essay provides a clear standpoint on the issue and presents valid arguments in favor of cooperation. To improve, consider fixing grammatical errors and strengthening the conclusion by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life.

However, as a weak student, I can only extend and improve upon existing ideas. Writing an entirely new paragraph centered on a new claim is too challenging for me unless very detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to construct the new paragraph, including its structure and reasoning, are provided.)
- Suggestion: “To provide a more balanced argument, consider including at least one claim that acknowledges that animal testing is inhumane.”
(Reason: As a weak student, I do not have enough details to implement this suggestion because even though a case-specific example of potential attacking claims is presented, the suggestion lacks detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to construct the counter-argument paragraph including its structure and reasoning.)
- Suggestion: “Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay. However, if you include attacking claims in the future, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the concerns raised and provides evidence and reasoning supporting your standpoint.”
(Reason: Since no attacking claims are added in the revision, there is no need to add a rebuttal either.)
- Suggestion: “The conclusion is brief and does not effectively summarize and reinforce the main arguments and thesis of the essay.”
(Reason: As a weak student, I encounter difficulty in implementing this generic suggestion because it merely outlines the potential drawbacks of the current conclusion, lacking a directive stating the actions to take to refine the conclusion.)
[THINKING_SEP]
With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that in some cases, it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.
First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.
Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing.
To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.
