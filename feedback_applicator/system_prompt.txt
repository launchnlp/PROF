Essay: Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?  
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.
First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.
Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.

All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life. For example, a study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that students who participated in cooperative learning activities had higher academic achievement and better social skills compared to those who did not. In contrast, competition often focuses on individual success, which may lead to a lack of cooperation and teamwork.
On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Let's take the Olympic Games, the pinnacle of athletic competition, as an example. In events such as the relay race, individual athletes must work together seamlessly as a team, passing the baton with precision and timing to secure victory. The success of the team relies not only on the individual skills and performance of each athlete but also on their ability to cooperate and synchronize their efforts. Without cooperation, the team would not be able to achieve the desired outcome, and victory would be out of reach.
Although, it is true that competition can foster innovation and individual growth and may teach important life skills, such as resilience and determination. In an economy where companies are constantly competing for customers and resources, there is a strong incentive to improve products and services, which can lead to technological advancements and increased productivity. However, it is also important to recognize the limitations of competition and the potential drawbacks of a highly competitive society. For instance, research has shown that excessive competition can lead to burnout, decreased motivation, and a lack of creativity. In addition, a highly competitive environment can lead to a culture of individualism, where people are more focused on their own success than on the success of others. This can lead to social isolation and a lack of cooperation, which can ultimately hinder societal progress.
Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.
