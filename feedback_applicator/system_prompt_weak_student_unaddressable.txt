As a student, your objective is to enhance your essay by incorporating received feedback into a revised version without refining those parts that are not covered in the Feedback. Also, as a student you will mostly address directive parts of the feedback. Typically, to address the feedback there are following types of changes that you usually do which are defined as follows:
- Surface Change: Mechanical changes in spelling or grammar; simple word change; deletion or addition of one or two words. (For example: "Szybek further supports the claim that everyday knowledge aids in scientific knowledge" -> "Szybek further supports the claim that specific contexts aid in scientific knowledge")
- Extended Content: Elaboration and/or justification of an existing point or example. (For example: ".is used for the non-knowledge-rich context because it does not necessarily encourage scientific thinking." -> ".is used for the non-knowledge-rich context because it does not necessarily encourage scientific thinking. While it non-scientific conversation can occur in a museum and scientific conversation can occur in a coffeehouse, this study is designed to determine if the rate of scientific conversation will differ between the two contexts.")

Essay: Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?  
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.
First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.
Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.


Feedback: Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and well-elaborated, stating that cooperation should be given more importance during primary education. However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced. Consider adding qualifiers such as \"often\" or \"in many cases\" to acknowledge that there may be situations where competition is also beneficial.
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay presents two distinct argumentative claims in favor of cooperation: 1) Cooperation helps children learn interpersonal skills that are significant for their future, and 2) Competition requires cooperation to achieve success. These claims are clear and aligned with the thesis statement.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The essay provides reasoning for both claims, explaining how cooperation helps children learn skills such as listening, communication, and compromise. It also provides an example of how competition in the Olympic games requires the cooperation of various professionals. However, the essay lacks specific evidence to support these claims. Consider providing examples or research studies that demonstrate the benefits of cooperation in developing interpersonal skills and achieving success in competitive situations.
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any distinct argumentative claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement. Consider adding at least one claim that presents a counterargument to make the essay more balanced and persuasive.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay. However, if you add an attacking claim, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the counterargument and provides specific evidence or reasoning to support your standpoint.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main arguments and thesis of the essay. However, it could be strengthened by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life, such as personal relationships, work environments, and global cooperation for solving complex problems. Additionally, consider ending the conclusion with a thought-provoking statement or a call to action to leave a lasting impact on the reader.
Overall, the essay provides a clear standpoint on the issue and presents valid arguments in favor of cooperation. To improve, consider adding qualifiers to the thesis statement, providing specific evidence to support the claims, adding at least one attacking claim, and strengthening the conclusion by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life.

Essay: Lessons with teachers versus others sources
Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.
Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.
Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.
Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?


Feedback: Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and presents the author's standpoint on the issue. However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced. Consider adding qualifiers to indicate the degree or extent to which students learn from teachers compared to other sources. For instance, make use of "generally" or "in most cases" in the line "Personally, I think ... from their teachers than from other sources.".
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay presents only one distinct argumentative claim in favor of the author's standpoint. To strengthen the argument, consider adding at least one more distinct claim that supports the thesis statement. For example, you could argue that teachers provide personalized feedback and guidance, which is not available through other sources.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The evidence provided to support the claim is not specific and lacks depth. Instead of making general statements, provide specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate how teachers teach students skills and help them overcome obstacles. Additionally, provide reasoning to explain why teachers are better equipped to teach students how to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources.
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any claims attacking the author's standpoint. To provide a balanced argument, consider presenting at least one distinct claim that challenges the idea that the vast array of online resources may compensate personalized teaching experience from the teachers.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal. However, if you add attacking claims, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the opposing arguments and provides specific evidence or reasoning to counter them.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion is brief and does not effectively summarize and reinforce the main arguments and thesis of the essay. To improve the conclusion, restate the thesis statement and briefly summarize the main points made in the essay. End with a strong closing statement that reinforces the author's standpoint.
Overall, the essay would benefit from adding qualifiers to the thesis statement, presenting additional claims in favor of the author's standpoint, providing specific evidence and reasoning, considering attacking claims and rebuttals, and improving the quality of the conclusion.

- Provide reasoning that explains why teachers are uniquely positioned to teach discernment between reliable and unreliable sources.
  - Addition: "Teachers, with their specialized training and experience, are equipped to guide students through the process of critical evaluation, teaching them to question and analyze the credibility of information in a way that autonomous online learning cannot ensure."
- Enhance the conclusion to provide a stronger summary of the essay's arguments and a more impactful closing statement.
  - Revised conclusion: "In conclusion, while alternative sources of information such as the internet offer vast knowledge, the role of teachers in providing a structured, interactive, and accountable learning environment remains unparalleled. We must acknowledge the irreplaceable value of educators in shaping not just academic but also ethical capacities in students. Let's champion the enduring impact of teachers in our journey of lifelong learning."

Essay: Using animals for the benefit of the human beings
With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.
First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.
Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing.
To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.


Feedback: Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and presents the author's standpoint on the issue. However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced and balanced. Consider adding qualifiers such as \"in some cases\" or \"under certain circumstances\" to acknowledge potential limitations or exceptions to the argument.
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay only presents one distinct argumentative claim in favor of the author's standpoint. To strengthen the argument, consider adding at least one more distinct claim. For example, you could argue that animal testing has led to significant medical advancements that have saved countless human lives.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The evidence provided to support the claim is not specific and lacks depth. Instead of making general statements, provide specific examples or statistics to illustrate the impact of animal testing on human health and well-being. Additionally, the reasoning behind the claim could be further elaborated to strengthen the argument. Explain why animal testing is necessary and how it ensures the safety and effectiveness of new products.
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any distinct claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement. To provide a more balanced argument, consider including at least one claim that acknowledges that animal testing is inhumane.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay. However, if you include attacking claims in the future, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the concerns raised and provides counterarguments supported by evidence and reasoning.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion is brief and does not effectively summarize and reinforce the main arguments and thesis of the essay. To improve the conclusion, restate the thesis statement and briefly summarize the main points made in the essay. End with a strong closing statement that reinforces the author's standpoint and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
Overall, the essay would benefit from providing more distinct claims, specific evidence, and in-depth reasoning to support the author's standpoint. Additionally, considering and addressing potential counterarguments would strengthen the argument and make it more persuasive.

Essay: Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?  
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.
First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.
Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.


Feedback: Thesis Statement: The thesis statement is clear and well-elaborated, stating that cooperation should be given more importance during primary education. However, it lacks qualifiers to make it more nuanced. Consider adding qualifiers such as \"often\" or \"in many cases\" to acknowledge that there may be situations where competition is also beneficial.
Claims in favor of author's standpoint: The essay presents two distinct argumentative claims in favor of cooperation: 1) Cooperation helps children learn interpersonal skills that are significant for their future, and 2) Competition requires cooperation to achieve success. These claims are clear and aligned with the thesis statement.
Evidence and Reasoning for supporting claims: The essay provides reasoning for both claims, explaining how cooperation helps children learn skills such as listening, communication, and compromise. It also provides an example of how competition in the Olympic games requires the cooperation of various professionals.
Claims attacking author's standpoint: The essay does not present any distinct argumentative claims attacking or refuting the thesis statement. Consider adding at least one claim that presents a counterargument to make the essay more balanced and persuasive.
Rebuttal for attacking claim: Since there are no attacking claims presented, there is no need for a rebuttal in this essay. However, if you add an attacking claim, make sure to provide a well-elaborated rebuttal that addresses the counterargument and provides specific evidence or reasoning to support your standpoint.
Quality of Conclusion: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main arguments and thesis of the essay. However, it could be strengthened by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life, such as personal relationships, work environments, and global cooperation for solving complex problems.
Overall, the essay provides a clear standpoint on the issue and presents valid arguments in favor of cooperation. To improve, consider adding qualifiers to the thesis statement, providing specific evidence to support the claims, adding at least one attacking claim, and strengthening the conclusion by reinforcing the importance of cooperation in various aspects of life.

[THINKING_SEP]
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should often attach more importance to cooperation during primary education, recognizing that competition can also be beneficial in certain contexts.
First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition. 
Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation, we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitude towards life is more profitable in one's success. In conclusion, while competition has its place in promoting personal excellence and innovation, a cooperative attitude is more broadly beneficial in one's success across personal relationships, professional environments, and global challenges
