{"label": "", "predict": "Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: There are a few concepts missing here and there is one concept that doesn’t belong. The first concept that is missing is a real world connection to the prompt that shows the economic impact that a minimum wage increase has on the labor market and automation market. The writer should’ve written about how a minimum wage increase would cause a shift in consumer demand away from goods that are produced by low-skilled labor, leading to reduced sales and profits, and how automation is the only way for businesses to maintain this income to make ends meet. The second concept that is missing is the concept of what would happen in the market for goods if there wasn’t a ban on automation. It would be important to point out how the lack of demand would result in an economic surplus, causing the price of the good to drop.\nAs for the concept that does not belong here, it would be unnecessary for the writer to write about how automation would decrease the supply of workers in the labor market. It is a mistake for the writer to write this when in reality the supply of workers in the labor market would increase due to the minimum wage increase, as there are more people who are able to work.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: One way for the writer to connect concepts in a more useful manner would be to give a better transition to the third paragraph of their paper, where they talk about the impact of a ban on automation on the market for goods. It is confusing to read at this point in the paper because we don’t know what a ban on automation would do to the supply of goods. To improve this, the writer could connect their first and second paragraphs by talking about how a minimum wage increase is what is pushing the businesses to look for automation to maintain their income.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: One way to improve the analysis of the minimum wage increase would be to better define what the minimum wage is and the effect it has on the market. The author could do this by describing the concept of the price floor of the minimum wage and explaining how it can’t be reached as a consumer demand level and how this affects the market.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: In their analysis, the author does a good job of applying economic principles to justify their position of opposing the ban on automation. One way the author could apply economics to make their argument more persuasive would be to talk about the elasticity of a business to this ban. For example, in this case, the elasticity is high which means that businesses that heavily rely on automation would be severely hurt by this ban.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The author did not use any outside sources for the paper.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: The letter is generally understandable to someone with basic knowledge of economics. For example, the author did a good job of explaining the effect of a minimum wage increase and how this would affect the labor market by stating that a higher minimum wage makes it harder for companies to hire as many employees as they would like. As for parts that are difficult to understand, the author could improve the explanation of the effects on the market for goods by giving a better transition between their second and third paragraphs."}

However, this author did not mention the shift in the supply curve from the minimum wage in the beginning paragraph. They may include how it is non-binding or binding shift.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: This author had very clear, understandable language in their essay, and I liked how they explained the relationship between minimum wage and the supply and demand curves. However, this author did not explain the relationship between the shifts in both curves from the increase in minimum wage.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: This author did a very good job explaining the shifts in the curves and the effects of minimum wage on the shifts of the curve, although the author missed a connection between the shifts of the curve. However, the author's explanation on the effect of the tax is very well-written and clear to understand. The author may consider using more examples to reinforce the effects of the tax.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: I thought this author did a very good job applying economic principles to justify their position on the tax, but this author should have applied economic principles to justify the argument against the tax as well. As an example, I may want to include an example of how a loss in efficiency would affect the market.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The citation is there!\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: I thought this author did a very good job writing for an audience with basic knowledge of economics. I thought the first paragraph was very clear and easy to understand.

Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: The author does an excellent job explaining concepts such as the labor market's demand and supply, surplus, deadweight losses, and black markets. However, an essential concept the author missed out on is the impact that a shift in the minimum wage has on the price consumers pay.  Additionally, there are a couple of sections that I believe are unnecessary. The author writes, \"These workers fail to evolve and improve with the market\" and \"These hidden costs and long-term consequences on the global market are detrimental to the economic development of our city.\"  I don't believe this was necessary for the assignment.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The author does a fantastic job connecting concepts to demonstrate how they interact in the market. For example, they write, \"When the city increased the minimum wage above the equilibrium wage rate, the wage is now binding, meaning that it has an impact on the supply and demand balance in the labor market. This led to an increase in the cost of labor for businesses, which caused businesses to reduce their demand for labor.\" This example shows a clear and logical relationship between the price floor and how that impacts supply and demand. The author can show this by better connecting the minimum wage increase to the impact on demand in the automation market. In this way, they can show more of the relationship between the labor and automation markets.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: I believe that the author did a good job analyzing minimum wage and the automation ban. I would suggest that they show the ban on automation as an example of a binding regulation and the role that that would have on the market. This would give the author a more in-depth analysis of the ban itself, rather than just talking about its effects, which they do a good job with.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author applies economic principles really well to justify their position. One additional way they could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive is by talking about the elasticity of the demand for automation. This is a concept they do not discuss that would support their claims.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: I noticed the author used an outside source that he cited. However, the in-text citation is missing. It needs to look like a parenthetical citation, like (Saltsman).\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: The author does a great job explaining the economic concepts that I believe a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economics would understand. I do believe that the last paragraph of their essay was difficult to understand, as they mentioned \"hidden costs and long term consequences.\" I did not feel like they added anything to the argument and it felt like a sort of conclusion or final thoughts. They should consider taking that out and replacing it with a way to show that the market would be inefficient in the long run without the automation."}

Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: The writer seems to be missing the concept of consumer and producer surplus, as the letter does not discuss the consequences of the proposed automation ban or the effects of the price floor on surplus. Additionally, the writer could clarify the concept of substitutes, explaining how automation is an alternative to human labor rather than a complementary input. Also, the writer doesn't seem to discuss the difference between short run and long run consequences of automation ban. Finally, the writer can discuss the concept of deadweight loss.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The author can discuss the interaction between the labor market and automation market more clearly, stating that increasing minimum wage in the labor market increases the demand for automation in the automation market. The author also could discuss how the increase in the demand for automation causes an increase in its supply.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author could improve their analysis by discussing the consequences of a binding price floor in the labor market, such as unemployment and the subsequent loss of consumer and producer surplus. Additionally, the author can discuss the concept of deadweight loss that would occur due to a total ban on automation. The author could provide a clear explanation of why substitutes would lead to a decrease in the demand for the good in question.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author could improve their argument by discussing the concept of elasticity of demand, mentioning how the demand for goods may be price-elastic or inelastic due to a ban on automation, therefore affecting the potential revenue that producers could generate. Additionally, the author can discuss how elasticity of supply can play a role in the labor market with automation.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The writer is using in-text citations, the author name in first part of sentence and page number in second part.

There is no discussion of total surplus or total revenue from the market.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: In their first paragraph, the student writes: \"With an increase in minimum wage, the price floor rises and the price becomes binding because it is above equilibrium.\" The student should say that the minimum wage increases from a non-binding price to a binding price and then explain that is a price floor because it is set above the equilibrium price by the government.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The student could talk about why a ban on automation is inefficient for the market. One of the ways this could be done would be by mentioning the inefficiency that would come from not allowing the market to equilibrate with the supply of a good and the demand.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The student does a good job of discussing the effects of raising the minimum wage as well as the effects of a ban on automation.

One of the biggest ones I think are missing are any discussions on the impact of minimum wage on unemployment, which was a topic we discussed throughout the year. I think these topics, such as elasticity, income effect, and substitution effect would enhance the essay and bring more credibility.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The concepts are all interconnected in a logical manner, in my opinion. I believe that more explanations and examples would help with clarity and make the writing even more compelling. When explaining a concept, rather than just defining it or explaining it briefly, I suggest that you use specific examples to demonstrate what you are talking about. This could be a hypothetical scenario or real-world data to show the effects that the various policies have on the economy.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: One of the most beneficial changes you could make would be to add more data and specific numbers to further enhance your points. The analysis that I see in this paper is mostly based on what you see around us in society, rather than actual data collected. Using this data could help with making a stronger analysis.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author does a great job at applying economic principles to justify his/her position. One thing I think you could add to the essay would be more on how the impact on the labor market affects the producers and consumers and the potential impact it may have on the economy. For example, an impact on the prices of a product if minimum wage is raised, which may cause unemployment.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: All outside sources are properly cited.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: The essay is very understandable for someone with a basic understanding of economic principles. I did have a little difficulty understanding some parts, but they were still logical and followed the main idea of your argument. One part that I think could be explained more clearly is the difference between \"binding\" and \"non-binding\" when it comes to price floors.

{"label": "", "predict": "Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: While the author has a good overview of concepts, they do not fully explain the connection between the automation market and the market for goods produced by humans. I recommend that the author explain that when automation replaces human labor, the supply of goods and services produced by humans decreases, leading to an increase in price and a decrease in consumer demand. Additionally, the author briefly touches on consumer and producer surplus, but doesn’t fully explain how these concepts relate to the ban on automation. I would recommend adding a paragraph that explains these in a way that connects to the ban on automation, explaining that because of the ban, there is less supply of goods and services, and therefore less surplus, which in turn negatively affects the market.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The author could better connect the concepts in the letter by using transitions and connecting sentences that create a sense of continuity between ideas. For example, when the author writes, “When it is non binding, the price floor is below equilibrium, allowing the market to move towards equilibrium” and then goes straight into describing an effect of the non-binding price floor without any connecting sentences, it creates a sort of non-sequential feel in the letter. Instead, the author could explain how the concept discussed in the first sentence is then an effect of the market due to the increase in minimum wage. Additionally, I would recommend moving the explanation of consumer and producer surplus after the explanation of a ban on automation. The author has an effective argument that is well-structured and coherent, and with some minor revisions, could be more persuasive.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author’s analysis of the minimum wage increase and the ban on automation are both thorough, but one area that could be improved on is the explanation of the impact the ban on automation has on businesses. Instead of writing, “This ultimately leads to a decrease in consumers purchasing the good or service which in turn decreases the revenue of the companies,” the author could more thoroughly explain the impact on businesses, including how they will need to pay workers a higher minimum wage, and how businesses will need to adjust to these changes in order to stay in business. This is done in the quote from Saltsman, but the author could expand upon this quote and explain it more thoroughly in their own words. For example, the author could explain how the increased costs of labor could cause businesses to struggle financially and potentially go out of business, which could have devastating effects on their customers.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: One additional way the author could apply economic principles to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive is by including a discussion on elasticity. The author mentions that the increased costs of labor could cause businesses to struggle financially and potentially go out of business, but by including a discussion on elasticity, the author could include how certain goods or services may be less elastic than others and how these goods and services may be more susceptible to the impact of the ban on automation. By including a discussion on elasticity, the author could help clarify the impact of the ban on automation on businesses and better explain why they believe a ban on automation is harmful to the economy.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The outside source is properly cited in the letter.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles.

For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The author could explain how if there was a price ceiling on the minimum wage, the equilibrium will shift left to show how prices are not only lower, but also how the quantity of supply of laborers decreases, showing this demand for human laborers goes down.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author could explain how this tax would harm consumer and producer surplus, or how the goods would increase in price for consumers to purchase due to automation being lessened.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position?

Also, there is a sentence \"These higher prices will be closer to prices to the one consumers are willing to pay, thus decreasing consumer surplus\" that is hard to understand because it is trying to say that the higher prices would cause a decrease in surplus, but it would actually cause an increase in surplus for consumers.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: In the first paragraph, the author talks about how labor and automation are substitutes, but I don't think that is true because labor and automation are more complements. The sentence \"If the price of labor increases, the demand automation will increase\" is also not entirely correct, it should say \"the demand for labor will decrease\" instead of demand for automation increasing.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author does a good job explaining the effects of a minimum wage increase, but the sentence \"Equilibrium will move and the prices of goods will increase, pushing consumers away\" is a bit misleading and does not fully explain the move in equilibrium correctly.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position?

The student could also better explain why businesses are motivated to use more automation to offset costs, as they are currently very vague. The student could also improve their analysis by considering the long-run and short-run market impacts of the policies.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author could apply economics in their argument by discussing the elasticity of the labor market and how it affects price responsiveness to changes in the minimum wage. The author could also discuss how an automation ban affects not only the labor market but also the goods and services market, as they have a greater impact on the supply and demand of goods and services.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: Yes, all sources are cited properly in the format required for the assignment.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: The letter was mostly understandable to a person with basic knowledge of economic principles.

For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The author could be more specific about the connection between concepts to make the argument stronger. For example, a greater emphasis on minimum wage increase leads to unemployment which leads to a demand for automation and a supply of goods. The author could discuss the role of the supply and demand curves in the market, as their explanation lacks that component. With that in mind, the author could have more in depth discussions of the labor market, goods market, and automation market.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author could have included the role of the production and cost in the market more into their analysis of the minimum wage increase. The author does talk about this somewhat, but their discussion is very brief and doesn't provide any context to support the claim. For example, minimum wage increases can lead to firms raising their prices due to the increase in labor costs.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author can apply the concept of elasticity to their argument in order to make it more persuasive. The author can discuss the elasticity of demand and how it changes in response to a minimum wage increase. A greater emphasis on elasticity can show how the market can become more responsive to change. The author could also discuss how a ban on automation can lead to a decrease in supply, affecting total surplus and increasing prices which can affect consumer behavior.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: There were no outside sources cited.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: The letter was very well-written and was understandable. The only parts of the letter that I may have had some confusion about is when the author states \"When minimum wage is nonbinding, the price is set below the market equilibrium.\" While I think the author is trying to explain the difference between nonbinding and binding, I'm not sure if it is entirely clear.

Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author can improve their application of economic principles by talking about how the demand and supply curve shifts more in depth to help us understand it better.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The author has proper in-text citations for all of their outside sources and a correct bibliography. However, the author failed to put the authors name in alphabetical order.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: The letter is understandable to someone with no economic knowledge.

For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: There are two big changes I would make in this essay. First, I would make a more explicit connection between how minimum wage affects the labor market and the automation market. This could be done by stating how the minimum wage increase creates demand for the automation market. Second, I would make more explicit connections between how a ban on automation affects the other markets. For example, you could mention that if the supply of workers is limited then the demand for the goods produced in that market will also be limited. In this way, you can show the reader how the ban on automation would cause the goods and services market to change.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: Overall, the analysis of the minimum wage is pretty thorough. However, I would emphasize how this is not a shift in demand, rather a shift in supply. This is important in that it is not a preference for more goods and services from consumers which makes it different than other price increases. The last change I would make to this part is to explicitly state the market inefficiency which is the shift in supply.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: I like how the author uses terms like \"deadweight loss\" and \"inefficient allocation.\" Additionally, the last paragraph is very persuasive.

Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: The author correctly mentions the concept of a binding price floor, and the idea of the minimum wage increase leading to an equilibrium price that is too high for work. However, the author does not mention the concept of the market as a whole shifting to the left. This is due to the fact that there is an input that is not binding in the long run. In the long run, labor is not a binding constraint.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The author does a good job of explaining the interaction between the labor market and the goods market.

For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The author explains that a higher minimum wage shifts the supply curve, moving it upward and to the left. I think it would be helpful for the author to be more explicit about how this shift affects the various markets.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author could improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy by providing a more nuanced picture of how elasticity affects the markets.

However, there are two parts of the essay where there is a lack of information. One part is that the author does not mention the effect of the minimum wage increase on the price of the product made by labor. I think this is important because, as shown by our examples in class, an increase in the price of inputs can decrease the supply of a product. The other thing I think should be mentioned is the effect of the new employment after the ban on automation. Since automation is no longer used, there will be more jobs available for humans in general, but as the author said earlier, I believe that they will be unable to afford the new wage. I think the author could mention this in the argument. This argument could potentially strengthen the argument against the ban on automation.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: I think that the author does a very good job connecting the concepts from the start. I like that the author starts with the idea that automation is the substitute for labor, and then talks about the concept of a price floor and its effects on the market. However, I think that the author could connect the argument better by adding an example of the market. For example, I think it would be beneficial to use an example of a product made with labor, such as agriculture, and explain how this market would be affected in each possible outcome of the proposed policy. In addition, the author could better connect the fact that the cost of labor increases to how the market would be affected.

I like that the author explains how the ban on automation would cause a shortage in the labor market, as they do use the word \"eliminate.\" However, I think that the author should have written it as an \"eliminate of substitutes,\" because this is more precise. I think that the author also should have elaborated more on the effect of the ban on automation on the market. As mentioned earlier, I think it would be beneficial to use the examples of the product market and explain how the product market would be affected by the ban on automation.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position?

I think that the author could strengthen their argument by explaining more about how the ban on automation would affect the labor market, and that would be through a shortage. Other than this, I do not think that they lack much information, because the author does explain most of the information needed for the reader to understand their argument, and then go on to elaborate on their argument and counterarguments in the second half of their argument.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: There are no outside sources being cited in the essay.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles.

This author touches on deadweight loss and the fact that it is a loss of efficiency, but I think it could be explained further as to what that means and what the consequences of it would be for the economy.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: One suggestion I would make for this author would be to use the example of a coffee shop and then discuss how a wage increase and the ban of automation affects the coffee shop and the customers that buy coffee there.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author does a good job of understanding that both the wage increase and the ban on automation are binding, and in turn could lead to higher prices for consumers. One thing I would mention is the fact that the ban on automation is not only going to lead to higher prices, but the lack of innovation that a ban on automation brings will also lead to lower supply.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author does a good job of using economic principles to justify their position. One way to make this letter more persuasive is to use the concepts of surplus and scarcity to discuss how the ban on automation will lead to consumer and producer surplus in a coffee shop for example, but also explain how the scarcity of workers will lead to lower supply in that same coffee shop.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The author cites the article that was required and also added a second outside source which is needed.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles.

Which parts were easy to understand?: The author does a great job of explaining everything needed for someone with basic knowledge of economic principles. One part that is a little difficult to understand is when the author writes \"This reaction encourages businesses to seek out cost-saving alternatives, such as layoffs. These alternatives create an increased reliance on automation to maintain productivity while controlling expenses.\" This is a little confusing because I think the word \"reaction\" should be replaced with \"consequence\" and the word \"layoffs\" could be better explained."}
{"label": "", "predict": "Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: An important concept missing from this essay is the concept of the marginal cost and benefit of automation as the writer seems to be focused on the direct effect of a ban. It could be improved if they could explain how an increased minimum wage is also increasing the marginal cost of labor. \nOne unnecessary concept used in this essay is the fact that the automation can create new jobs such as in technology, maintenance, and oversight. While these jobs do exist, it may not be the case in certain industries where automation is heavily utilized. To fix this issue, the writer could have stated that automation creates a transition from manual labor to automation, allowing for more productivity to create more jobs.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The writer could use the idea of equilibrium to help their audience understand how these policies will affect the market. For example, if the price of minimum wage was too high, firms would begin to substitute away from labor and towards automation to maintain their level of production while also attempting to break even (make a profit). This could be a way to help them see how the various markets (labor and automation) affect each other. The writer also could use the idea of elasticity to describe how sensitive the demand is to this ban on automation, and how it is affecting the market.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The writer did a great job at using economic principles to support their argument against the ban. However, they may want to have their audience visualize the labor and automation market, especially if they are a non-economist. They could do this by stating that the labor market is like the supply curve of a good, and the automation market is the demand curve. When the price of minimum wage goes up, the demand for automation goes up as more businesses will want to substitute away from labor and towards automation to maintain their level of production. \nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author does a great job at using economic principles to justify their position, particularly when discussing why the ban on automation could cause prices to increase. However, they may want to have their audience understand the long-term effects of banning automation. They could do this by stating that in the long run, if automation was banned, the cost of production would continue to rise and create an unsustainable situation where the market is not at equilibrium. They could also mention that these prices are not just imposed on the producer, but the consumer.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: Yes, the outside sources are properly cited.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: One part that may be difficult for the audience to understand is when the writer states that the economic rationale for opposing the ban on automation lies in its potential to hinder economic growth, innovation, and the overall competitiveness of San Francisco’s businesses. To help the audience understand, they could describe this in more terms of what it means to \"hinder economic growth\" in the context of a market, which is that it is in fact a decrease in production, causing the market to not be at equilibrium.\nOverall, however, the writer does a great job at using their audience's prior knowledge of economics to help them understand their argument."}

For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: I think that one way that you could connect the concepts in your paper in a more useful way is to make it clear how the different markets are affected by an increase in minimum wage. You should talk about how the labor market is affected by the increase in minimum wage and also go on to talk about the automation market as well. For example, if you talk about an increase in the price of labor, you can then talk about how automation becomes cheaper, which is an important connection that highlights the consequences of the increased price of labor.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: One way that you could improve your analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban) is to talk about long-term consequences of a ban on automation. You talk about how it could increase unemployment and decrease productivity, but you could talk about how this could negatively affect the market and society as a whole. You also could go on to talk about how it could also lead to a decrease in consumer surplus and an increase in producer surplus.

However, I did not notice any unnecessary concepts that are used to detract from the writing.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: One way that the author could better connect concepts is when they say \"Additionally, a ban on automation would not fix the underlying issue of job displacement, being that the issue was caused by the minimum wage increase in San Francisco\". Although this is true, the author can add more context to how the labor market and the consumer/producer surplus will change if automation is banned.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author can improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy by adding more context and evidence to their claim.

For example, the author could mention that higher automation could lead to increased productivity in the future, which would lead to increased economic growth and new job opportunities in areas such as software development and data analysis. Another point the author could emphasize is that the proposal of increasing the minimum wage is based on the assumption that it will help improve the living standards of low-income workers. However, the author could mention that a higher minimum wage can also lead to job losses and decreased economic efficiency. By discussing these points, the author can further apply economic principles to justify their position and make the letter more persuasive.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: Yes\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: Overall, this letter is generally understandable to someone with a basic understanding of economic principles, and it provides a clear explanation of the negative impacts of a minimum wage increase and the potential benefits of automation."}

Additionally, I think that the discussion on what might happen if minimum wage increases and how that would affect both the labor and automation market would strengthen the argument.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: In order to better connect these concepts, I think you should use more precise language to explain your ideas. For instance, in the paragraph, “Additionally, it takes long periods of time for the supply and demand curves to adjust to the loss of automation,” you state the shift will cause a drastic change to the supply curve. I think you should describe this shift more, such as it being a leftward shift since supply is reduced, thus driving up the price equilibrium. It would be easier to understand the relationship if it were more clear.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: One thing that caught my eye that would be helpful to include was an example of an industry that has had to incorporate more automation due to rising minimum wages.

This author uses many concepts from our lecture, the one mentioned above, in addition to deadweight loss, taxes, equilibrium, and binding and non binding price ceilings.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: In order to better connect the concepts the author may want to connect the concept of elasticity and the price elasticity of demand in the explanation of what happens to supply and demand with the tax on automation and how this affects prices. Additionally, they mention that producers will need to raise the price of products because of increased automation costs but do not explicitly mention what the increased automation costs are, it would be helpful to include this and connect it to the input side of supply and demand. This would give a better explanation of what happens to consumers and businesses alike.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: When the author says this, \"By levying an automation tax on producers, producers will need to charge more as an input in production, labor (automation) costs more, raising the marginal cost of products sold. At minimum, producers want to be able to receive their marginal cost at the original equilibrium price plus the tax at the equilibrium quantity, but if they charge more, supply will not meet demand, and disequilibrium will occur, so there will be a pressure on price.\" I would suggest rewording this to more accurately reflect what happens to the market with an added tax on automation, because they mention an increase in input costs but do not include the elasticity of the demand for automation and how this relates to the supply of goods.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author applies many economic principles to support their argument that a tax on automation is bad for the market. They include terms such as marginal cost, equilibrium, demand, supply, etc. The one thing they could use to make their argument better would be to mention that in the long run consumers would become more efficient and the cost of goods and services would decrease, but in the short run the market may be less efficient and prices may increase. Additionally the author mentions price elasticity but does not give a clear definition of what it is. I would suggest defining what price elasticity of demand is and what it means for the market.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The author does not cite the article that is required in the prompt, nor do they cite the source about the future of jobs.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles.

The language is easy to follow and all of the ideas are supported by logic and a little bit of economic principles. The one thing that made this letter more difficult to understand was the mention of elasticity of demand for automation, and its relationship to the supply of goods. I would suggest defining what elasticity of demand is."}

For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: I would recommend discussing the relationship between minimum wage and unemployment in more detail, highlighting that minimum wage is often viewed as a binding price floor, and its effect on employment is based on the elasticity of labor demand. Additionally, elaborating on how this relates to the automation market would enhance the paper.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: I think that the author could improve their analysis of the impact of a minimum wage increase by considering other factors beyond just the demand for automation. The paper mostly highlights that automation would increase productivity but doesn't think of the benefits in reducing labor costs and the resulting lower product prices, which would affect consumer surplus. I would also recommend discussing the implications of the policy at a macro level. how the increase in the cost of production due to minimum wage could have an economic multiplier effect.

{"label": "", "predict": "Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: The author touched on supply and demand within the letter. However, I don’t believe they addressed the idea of consumer surplus or producer surplus that would have made a great addition. If the letter were expanded to be 500 words, I would suggest adding some information on that.  While the author touched on equilibrium with their explanation of how the market changes with the price of labor increasing and automation not being allowed to happen.

Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author could apply more economics to their argument by touching on the concept of marginal utility.  As the supply of workers gets higher and more expensive, companies may not have as much need for them. As a result, consumers would have to pay for the workers and in return would gain in satisfaction but lose in efficiency.  Additionally, if the author chose to add in a little bit about the concept of opportunity cost, that would also be effective in justifying their position.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The author properly cited the outside source.

In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: The sentence that states “These changes result in a surplus of people looking for jobs and a shortage of employees willing to provide people with the jobs under the new minimum wage” is difficult to understand. This is because it is worded confusingly, and the use of the terms surplus and shortage is confusing when the concept of the market is still new to most people reading.

Explaining why the ban on automation leads to inefficiency and how that would negatively affect the overall market.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The in text citation is properly cited but I think it would be better with a corresponding Works Cited page and in-text citation.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: This letter is well written and overall easy to read and understand."}
{"label": "", "predict": "Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: The writer could have added more about how raising the price floor would cause inefficiency in the short-term but how over the long-run it could potentially increase efficiency in a long-run equilibrium. I think the writer could also include more about the market of goods which would connect more with the labor market. For example, they could discuss how raising the wage would potentially increase the price of goods because employers would need to absorb the loss of profits from paying their employees a higher wage. The writer might also have referred to the term surplus for the labor market, as it is a significant concept.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: I think the author could have done a better job at connecting concepts by using terms like surplus or elasticity. The author could have also referred to how Mr. Yee and Ms. Kim's proposals cause inefficiency and how they both would cause unintended consequences. I believe the author could have also used specific examples to illustrate the concept more and make it easier to understand. I found that the author only discussed the labor market, without discussing other markets that would be affected by Mr. Yee's policy. A lot of information could be added by discussing the market of goods and the market of automation and how the three markets all affect each other.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: I think the author did a good job with analyzing the ban on automation, but I believe that they could have done a better job analyzing the minimum wage increase. I think the author could have discussed the short-run inefficiency that would be caused by the minimum wage increase. I think the author could have discussed how it would create unemployment because of its inefficiency. I found that the author barely discussed the minimum wage increase, but I believe that they did a good job analyzing the ban on automation. I thought that the author could have gone more in depth about how a ban would cause inefficiency and unintended consequences. The author could have also added more about how automation helps the consumer by giving them a wide variety of choices with price in mind.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: I think that the author applies a lot of economic principles to justify their position but I think the author could have also discussed how the ban on automation would increase the cost of the goods. I think that the author could have also discussed how a ban on automation would cause inefficient allocation and unemployment. I think the author could have also referred to how a ban on automation would cause a shortage in the market for labor and a surplus of goods that are labor-intensive and would be no longer produced with a ban on automation. Overall, I think that the author did a good job applying economic principles to justify their position.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: The author used one outside source and it is properly cited at the bottom of the article.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: I think that the letter was understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. I found that the writer did a good job breaking down the information in a way that the audience could understand. I found that the writer's examples and evidence was effective in making the audience understand the point that the writer is trying to make. Overall, I thought that the article was very easy to understand and the information was presented in a way that would make the audience understand and follow the writer's point."}
{"label": "", "predict": "Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: As the letter stands, I do not find that there are any concepts that are missing. However, I do believe that the last sentence \"There is no perfect solution for the worker, business, and consumer, instead, we must find the right balance between government regulation and the invisible hand of the free market\" is unnecessary. There is no economic concept that is being referenced, and I think that this is more of a commentary rather than an economic analysis. It does take away from the rest of the letter and I believe it is not necessary.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: I think that there are a few places that could be addressed to help the author connect economic concepts in a more useful manner. In the first paragraph, the author explains that \"While raising the minimum wage may initially improve the living standards of the working class, in the long run, it will do the opposite.\" I believe that there should be some more explanation of this, and I would suggest referencing how this relates back to the equilibrium of the labor market, and how that affects the supply and demand for labor. Similarly, in the third paragraph, the author explains how \"If workers must be paid more than it is worth to deliver food or packages and the only way to make it more cost-effective, automation, is banned\" I think that there should be more explanation of the relation between the price of wages and the demand and supply of delivery services. This would help the reader understand the connection between a change in the labor market and the market of delivery services.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: Overall, I think that the author's analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy is on point. The author does a good job of discussing the relationship between these two variables and explaining how they both affect the labor market. I think that there is nothing necessarily wrong with the analysis, just maybe some places where there could be more explanation or evidence from the provided reading.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: I think that the author does a good job of referencing economic principles to justify their position, particularly when it comes to discussing how the increase in minimum wage affects businesses and the market. However, I do think that there could be more evidence from the article provided. For example, in the first paragraph, I would reference the article when explaining how \"raising the minimum wage may initially improve the living standards of the working class, in the long run, it will do the opposite.\" I think that this would help to explain how raising minimum wage affects not only consumers and businesses but also the overall market.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: Sources appear to be properly cited at the end of the letter in the Works Cited section.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: I think that the letter is generally easy to understand for someone with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. I think that one of the easiest sections to understand is when the author explains how the increase in minimum wage can affect businesses. The author explains how \"While this would provide a raise to the workers, businesses will be forced to reduce labor costs to keep their business profitable, meaning they will have to either begin laying off workers or charging more for their goods or services.\" I think that this is an easy concept to understand and that the reader can easily visualize how increasing minimum wage can affect businesses. I think that the only part of the letter that may be a little harder to understand is when the author is discussing the relationship between minimum wage and the automation market. I think that this is because the reader would need to have a more in depth knowledge of economic principles to understand how the"}
{"label": "", "predict": "Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: The paper is missing discussion about how the minimum wage increase affects consumer and producer surplus. It would be important to mention how price floors or the increase in minimum wage creates a surplus, and how this surplus affects consumer and producer surplus.\nUnderstanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: The author can talk about how the ban of delivery robots directly affects consumer surplus. Explaining how consumer surplus goes down as a result of this ban, which is a result of the price increase that consumers have to pay for their deliveries.\nCritical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: The author could improve their analysis by discussing the role of elasticity in the labor market. Explaining how minimum wage affects the elasticity of the labor market would help the reader understand how supply and demand are affected by changes in price.\nCritical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The author does a good job of applying economic principles to justify their position, but could do a better job by going more in depth and discussing supply and demand curves. Explaining how both the supply and demand curves affect the price of goods would help the reader understand how consumers are affected.\nCritical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: Yes.\nResponse Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: Overall the paper is very understandable to someone with a basic understanding of economics. One of the parts that might be confusing to someone with a basic understanding of economics is the part about the labor market going above the equilibrium price. It would be more helpful to break down what it means to be above the equilibrium price and how it affects both consumers and producers."}
