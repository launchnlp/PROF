Essay: To: San Francisco Board of Supervisors,

Hello, I am writing today to explain the impacts of the recently implemented $15 minimum wage as well as to express my concern for Norman Yee’s proposal to ban automation. 

The $15 minimum wage is an example of a price floor being instituted into a market. Not only does this price floor impact the labor market (the market it is implemented in), but it also affects related markets such as the automation market and the market for any goods produced with the use of labor. A price floor (the minimum wage) increases the supply of labor in the labor market. More labores want their services to be used due to the fact that they will be making more money. This is counteracted, however, by the decrease in demand for labor, a surplus of workers is created. Companies are less willing to hire workers because it costs them more money. This decrease in demand for workers in the labor market directly impacts the automation market. Labor and automation are substitutes in production, that is to say if the price of laborers increase (due to the minimum wage), companies are going to invest more into automation. A similar effect is seen in the markets of goods created through the use of labor. If a good is dependent on labor to be produced then the decrease in labor demanded will affect the market of this good. Less laborers means the supply for this good will decrease, causing a shortage. 

Norman Yee’s proposal to ban automation in San Francisco's current economic state is a bad idea. Mr. Yee fails to recognize the impact of the minimum wage on business. Companies are forced to rely on automation because it is cheaper than hiring workers with the new minimum wage. It is not the increased use of technology and automation that are taking jobs, rather it is the increase in minimum wage. An article in The Wall Street Journal frames this problem such, “The minimum wage will rise to $15 an hour in San Francisco in 2018. The rest of California will get there four years later. On top of San Francisco's hourly wage mandate are requirements for health care, paid leave and employee scheduling,” (Saltsman, 2017). These increased expenses for employees cause the labor market to be inefficient. Resources are wasted and there are high amounts of deadweight loss in the market. This inefficiency leads to the use of automation that Mr. Yee is trying to ban it. If automation was banned in tandem to the inefficient status of the labor market, many other markets would suffer. Since labor and automation are largely interchangeable, markets that rely on labor are not affected by the minimum wage. A ban in automation, however, would cause these markets to experience massive shortages as they would no longer have an efficient mode of production. Automation is the solution to the problem created by the increased Minimum Wage in San Francisco and to ban it would be a disastrous decision.

Feedback: Understanding 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, identify any important concepts that are missing. Identify any unnecessary concepts in use.: One important concept that is missing from your analysis is the comparison between efficiency and inefficiency. I think that you did a great job talking about these concepts individually, but they rely on each other to fully understand them, and you did not connect them in a clear manner. Additionally, you did not discuss the supply and demand curve/shift, which is a vital aspect of the situation and is imperative that the reader understands these ideas.
Understanding 2: How can the author connect concepts in a more useful manner? For example, using your knowledge from class, how could the author improve their explanation of interactions between the various markets affected by these policies?: You do a relatively good job at connecting concepts, but in some paragraphs you need to add more context. One instance is in your first paragraph when you are discussing the $15 minimum wage price floor. In the following sentences, you explained the concepts which relate to the price floor well, but you didn't explain why these ideas all work together, such as the labor and automation markets.
Critical Thinking 1: Based on your class discussion and course readings, how could the author improve their analysis of the minimum wage increase and the automation policy (ban or tax, depending)?: One way you could improve your analysis is by using more buzzwords instead of taking long phrases to explain concepts. Ideas such as "more laborers want their services to be used due to the fact that they will be making more money" can be cut down and made more efficient, which would in turn simplify your analysis and make it easier for your reader to understand. Other than these dragged out sentences, you have done a great job at addressing the problem in your analysis.
Critical Thinking 2: How well does the author apply economic principles to justify his/her position? Suggest one (or two) additional ways the author could apply economics to their argument in order to make this letter more persuasive.: The main way you could impliment economic principles is by using supply and demand curves in your analysis. Over the course of your paper, you do a great job at looking at all aspects of the issue, but you could have added more context to these aspects by looking deeper into supply and demand, and how a shift in the supply and demand graph may result in a different outcome. Other than that small change, you have done a great job at explaining economic concepts.
Critical Thinking 3: Are all outside sources properly cited?: There are no sources cited.
Response Alignment with Audience: The letter should be understandable to a person with a basic but not sophisticated understanding of economic principles. In this context, which parts were difficult to understand? Which parts were easy to understand?: The part of your essay that I had the most trouble understanding was your paragraph on the minimum wage floor. Although you mentioned all aspects involved and explained the important economic principles, I found there to be some holes in your explanation. The largest was seen in the idea that a good is dependent on labor to be produced. In your other paragraphs, I understood the concepts at a solid level and feel as though anyone reading your paper would think the same. Overall, you did a solid job in explaining the concepts as though your reader had a low level of sophistication.

Essay: A Concermed Citizen  1503 Washington Heights     
Ann Arbor, MI 48109     
February 15, 2024     
San Francisco Board of Supervisors  1 Dr Carlton B Goodlett Pl     
San Francisco, CA 94102     
Dear Members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors,     
I am writing to you as a concerned citizen to express my reservations regarding the proposed ban on automation in San Francisco, as advocated by Mr. Norman Yee, and to caution against corrective measures such as automation taxes proposed by Ms. Jane Kim. While I acknowledge the genuine concerns surrounding job displacement and economic stability, these policies could negatively affect the labor market and economic efficiency. (Saltsman)     
Jane Kim's proposal to tax companies for embracing automation reflects policymakers’ concern over rising minimum wages and increased automation. As a price floor, the minimum wage places a lower limit on market prices. These price floors are imposed when the government believes the equilibrium price to be incorrect. When the wage is nonbinding, it falls below the equilibrium price, permitting access, but when binding, the wage surpasses the equilibrium price, blocking access. Due to the wage increase, it is binding. The wage increase causes firms'     
    
demands for labor to decrease, showing a leftward demand shift. The supply of people who want to provide labor increases due to wage increases, furthering a rightward shift. As Michael    
Saltsman's article in The Wall Street Journal outlines, the rise in labor costs incentivizes businesses to explore automation via cost-saving means. Therefore, while the intentions behind    
Ms. Kim's proposal may be well-meaning, the policy risks heightening the very problems it seeks to address.     
Similarly, Mr. Yee's proposal to ban delivery robots in San Francisco overlooks the broader economic consequences of such a policy. Banning automation fails to recognize the benefits of technological advancement, including increased productivity and innovation. While concerns about job displacement are reasonable, prohibiting automation is not a viable solution. If automation were banned, firms would be compelled to use less labor, reducing product efficiency. As demand increases, this decrease in the supply of goods and services could lead to a rise in the equilibrium price and potential supply shortages.     
The economic impact of a minimum wage increase, particularly when it transitions from being non binding to binding, is significant. The rise in labor costs prompts businesses to explore automation as a cost-saving means, leading to a rightward shift in the automation market. This causes a surplus quantity of labor in the market. This shift increases demand for automated technologies and decreases labor demand, deepening job displacement concerns. Furthermore, as the equilibrium point adjusts in response to changes in labor costs, firms may find themselves in disequilibrium, with the quantity of labor supplied exceeding the amount demanded.     
    
For over a decade, shoppers have been responsible for packing their groceries. Meanwhile, fast-food chains like McDonald's and Panera Bread have implemented kiosks that allow customers to place their orders. However, banning automation outright or imposing taxes on it would disrupt market equilibrium and lead to inefficiencies. We must embrace technological advancements responsibly to harness their potential and create a more profitable and inclusive society.     
Thank you for considering my perspective on this critical issue.     
Sincerely,     
A Concerned Citizen
